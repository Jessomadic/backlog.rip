One of the most requested features is now live: Achievements have officially landed on Backlog.rip.
This significant update allows you to connect your games directly to your Steam achievements, providing a more comprehensive and personalized gaming experience.

You can now track your gaming milestones, unlock achievements manually, focus on specific goals, or even ignore ones you don't care about, giving you full control over your library.
This is a huge step forward in making Backlog.rip even more personalized and rewarding.
