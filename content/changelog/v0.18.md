**The "Community" update** is a major update that brings a lot of ground work to the app. This update includes a new community page, where users will appear based on their activity.

In a not very far future, the community page will be expanded to include users activity, public profiles and more.

## New features
- A new community page is now available.
- Users can now opt-out of the community and public profiles.

### Search improvements
- The search process is now faster and more efficient. Repeating searches will reuse the same search instance which will dramatically reduce overhead.
- The random sort option is now a button in the interface that will suggest a random game from the list.

### Cloud sync improvements
- The cloud sync feature now allows you to automatically resolve syncronization conflicts.

### General improvements
- Time to completion data is now fetched from IGDB in addition to HowLongToBeat.
- In the search interface, is possible to toggle the visibility of the game properties (name, release date, playtime, hltb, score, etc).

### Fixes
