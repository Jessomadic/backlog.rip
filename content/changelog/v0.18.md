This month, we're releasing a new version of Backlog with a lot of improvements and new features.

On Discord I asked you to tell me what changes you want to see in the app, and most of you told me that you wanted improvements in the current features. Version 0.18.6 brings several improvements and new features based on community feedback from our Discord channel, I focused on enhancing existing functionality and polishing the user experience.

## New features
- New random game picker. Click a button to see a random game. This is very helpful to decide what to play next.
- Now it's possible to sort games by Metacritic score and Steam recommendations (for local games only).
- The search interface now allows you to toggle the visibility of the game properties (name, release date, playtime, hltb, score, etc).

### Search improvements
- The search process is now faster and more efficient. Repeating searches will reuse the results which will dramatically increase performance.
- The random sort option is now a button in the interface that will suggest a random game from the list.
- Now the metacritic and steam scores are shown under the game name when sorting by those fields.
- There has been improvements when sorting by name with *diverse* characters.

### Cloud sync improvements
- The cloud sync feature now allows you to automatically resolve synchronization conflicts.

### General improvements
- Time to completion data is now fetched from IGDB in addition to HowLongToBeat.
- In the search interface, is possible to toggle the visibility of the game properties (name, release date, playtime, hltb, score, etc).

### Fixes
- Games won't be shuffled while searching by random.
