**Synchronize your whole library with the cloud**

The cloud sync feature is now available, allowing you to synchronize your data seamlessly across all your devices. This is a significant update, which has taken two months of work, and enhances your ability to access your data from anywhere, making it easier to manage your tasks on multiple devices.

For the time being, the cloud sync is a free feature and will remain free for all users without a limit. In the future, synchronization will have more features, and the price or limits will be determined by the contributions made by the users. If the service cost is not covered by the contributions, it will come with a price.

## New features
- Cloud Synchronization. You can now synchronize your data with the cloud and have it available everywhere.
- Now it is possible to clear a state previously set on a game. Thanks elThirtie!
