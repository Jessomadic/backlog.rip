**Create your own lists now**

The v0.16 update introduces custom lists, a new feature that lets users organize their games in personalized collections. You can now create custom lists and add any games to them, while also benefiting from integrated IGDB search results, you can add games even if they are not in your library.

## New features
- Custom lists can now be created and any game can be added to them
- When searching, in `all games` the results now directly include games from [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/)
- Now games can be displayed as a compact list instead of cards

### Improvements
- Now games have a border indicating their current state. This can be toggled on and off in the settings.
- Now it's possible to filter games by `no state`
- The default sort order for the library has been changed to `playtime`
- Playtime is now backed up to the cloud
- Now it's possible to to add custom games from the search results
- Made several improvements to handle the access in offline mode
- Greatly improved network traffic for game images using browser cache
