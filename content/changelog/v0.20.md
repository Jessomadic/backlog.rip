**The search feature is now out of Beta!**

The search and filter systems have received their biggest update yet, and with it, those features are now officially out of beta.

You can now search games anywhere in your library, or across the web and combine multiple filters of the same type, use modifiers like *is*, *is not*, *greater than*, and more, everything while filtering by new criteria such as genre, release date, playtime, and completion status. Filters are now also reflected in the URL, making it easy to share specific searches. This brings full flexibility and precision to how you explore your library.

This release marks a significant milestone on the road out of beta.
Search is no longer just functional. It's complete.
