![Add your games](/img/changelog/2024-07.png)

**Add any game you want!** Keep your library up to date

It’s now easier than ever to update your library. The synchronization is made automatically every 24 hours, so there’s no need to review each game manually. However, if you prefer, you can still disable the auto-updater and perform manual updates.

## New features
- Add any games you want to your library
- Mark a game as a favorite. It will be added to your library and shown in the favorites section
- Pin a game. It will be shown in a special list but won't be added to your library
- Hide a game. Hide it from your library and search results
- New library navigation menu to jump between your games, backlog, favorites...

### Improvements
- Added a new preferences section to manage your library and disable features like "pinned games" or "favorites"
- Improved display on games without score
- Improved the feeling on the right click menu
- Trying new display options for the search menu

### Fixes
-
